# ngb's pi2bot

***NOTE: PLEASE DO READ THE LICENSE FILE.***

### What is pi2bot?
pi2bot is a Discord Bot written in discord.py and aims to be both easily customizable, extensible by code and be rewritten in multiple programming languages (for my own self-learning and practice purpose).

### Why pi2bot instead of <insert-name>?
***NOTE: Unrelated to Discord or the bot itself***
pi2 is the team name of my Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series' (EoS and SMD so far), which consist of **Pi*kachu and **Pi**plup as main characters. 

The main reason I chose this name is due to it first coming out of my mind after I deem "ngbbot" too lame.

### Which language are you focusing now/going to plan on?
Python 3 will be the original language used to write pi2bot. A rewrite/binding of Ruby is planned and I should start it as soon as I am sastified with the original version.
